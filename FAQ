Linux
-----
Some versions of SuSE linux do not ship with libtermcap.a.  This
causes linker errors to included readline library (though they appear
to the user at the linking stage of simcalc) .  A solution is to
simply symbolic link:
 # ln -s libncurses.a libtermcap.a
.
Another solution is to edit the Makefile in the readline-2.0
subdirectory, but it is not recommended beacause the problem will
appear again when the user is going to install the newer version of
SIMATH.


Tru64
-----
Simcalc may output a message like "Unaligned access pid=1234 ...".
It is avoidable with typing following command before the user runs
simcalc:
 % uac p noprint
.
