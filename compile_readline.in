# This file checks the hosttype of the host currently compiling SIMATH.
# If the host is not an Apollo workstation, the readline library will be
# configured and compiled. On SGI systems, the compiler flag -DUSG will
# be added when compiling readline. This prevents readline from assuming
# the existence of BSD signals. (This is subject to change with a future
# readline version.) The check wether we are running on an Apollo system
# should be obsolete since Apollos are no longer supported.
