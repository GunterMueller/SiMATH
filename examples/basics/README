  This directory contains various smaller main programs demonstrating
some basic concepts of the SIMATH computer algebra system. If you are
not yet familiar with SIMATH, you may play a little bit with these
programs in order to get a feeling for these basic concepts.

  Each program contains a short description of what it calculates, so
it should be helpful for you to look at the sources of the programs
before executing them.
