        "ppoff"         disables the pseudoprimality check only. 

        "ppon"          enables the pseudoprimality check only. 


        By default, it is disabled. If it is enabled, the SIMATH function
        isiprime() (called directly (e.g. by isiprime) or indirectly (e.g.
        by fact)) will check only for pseudoprimality.
