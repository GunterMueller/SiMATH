        "ellitpic logarithm"
        SYNTAX: X = elog(P)

        P is an expression whose value is a point on the current
        elliptic curve. The current elliptic curve as well as the
        point P must be defined over Q.

        X is assigned the elliptic logarithm of the point P.


        Example 1: (correct)

                elog(PT(0, 3, 1))
