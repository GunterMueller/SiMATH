        "sign of the functional equation"
        SYNTAX: X = sgnfeq(E)

        E is an expression whose value is an elliptic curve over Q.

        X is assigned the sign of the functional equation of the
        modified Hasse-Weil L-function gamma.

        
        Example 1: (correct)

                sgnfeq( EC( 1, 0, 0, 1, 2 ) )
