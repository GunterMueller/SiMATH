                               * * * * * * *
                               * continue  *
                               * * * * * * *

        In loops, "continue" causes the next run of the surrounding 
        loop. In while- and dowhile-loops, the boolean expression is
        evaluated. In for-, forstep- and forprime-loops, the
        reinitialisation is done.
        Outside, it has no effect.
