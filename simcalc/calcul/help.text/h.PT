        "point"
        SYNTAX: X = PT(x, y, z)
                X = PT(x, y)

        x, y, z are expressions whose values are elements of Z, Q, Z/pZ
        (where p is a prime), GF(2^n) or a number field.

        Depending on the number of arguments, X is assigned a projective or
        affine point on an elliptic curve.

        Remark: Points on elliptic curves are displayed on the screen in
                a similar way they are entered, i.e.
                PT(x', y', z') ( where x', y' and z' are integers )
                or PT(x, y).

        Warning: If p > 2^30, the primality of p is not tested.
