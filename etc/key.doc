The SM keyword index allows you to search for SIMATH functions and
MACROs that match (or match not) a number of egrep Regular Expressions
(REs). A key is a RE or of the form !RE. In the latter case, all
functions not matching the RE are searched for. There will be no
destinction between uppercase/lowercase except in the case of a
reverse search. The number of keys is limited by 9.
