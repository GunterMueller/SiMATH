  The computer algebra system SIMATH is written in C. It is being
developed for research purposes by the SIMATH group of Prof. Dr. H.G.
Zimmer at the University of Saarland in Saarbruecken, Germany. The
development is being partially supported by the Siemens AG.

  Up to now we are running SIMATH
	on Sun workstations under SunOS 4.0.3 and SunOS 4.1.x,
	on HP 9000 series 700 under HP-UX 10.20
	on SGI computers under IRIX 5.2 and
	on PCs under different Linux kernels.
These are the machines we use for the development of SIMATH. It should
not be too difficult to port SIMATH to other operating systems. If you
are using a different machine (and/or operating system), you can (and
you should) try to install SIMATH. If you are successful, please let
us know. If you had to change some of the SIMATH source files, please
inform us of the changes to be made.

  Currently, SIMATH does not support any true 64 bit machine. We will
try to port SIMATH to 64 bit computers as soon as we have one available.

  We have set up an experimental mailing list related to the SIMATH computer 
algebra system. If you want to subscribe to this list send email to
	majordom@tnt.math.metro-u.ac.jp
and include the line 
	subscribe simath-user
in the body of your mail. The purpose of the list is to announce new versions 
of SIMATH and to discuss anything which is related to SIMATH and of public 
interest.

  The latest version of SIMATH may be obtained by anonymous ftp from
simath.math.metro-u.ac.jp (133.86.76.12) in the directory /simath/latest/ .
