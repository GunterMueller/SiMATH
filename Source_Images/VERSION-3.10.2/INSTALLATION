 0. This is (still) one of the first versions of SIMATH which is
    installed by Makefiles instead of shell scripts. Therefore there
    might be some minor bugs in the installation procedure.

    We have been working on a simplification of the installation
    procedure, and SIMATH-3.10.2 uses gnu autoconf, i.e "configure"
    shell scripts, to determine most of its configuration parameters.

    At least on SGI and Apollo (and probably on HP) computers, you will
    need GNU "make". GNU "make" is available from many ftp servers all
    over the world, and it compiles even on Apollos without problems.
    Be sure that GNU "make" is actually named "make" and occurs in the
    search path of your shell before the system's "make". If you are
    not sure whether your "make" can handle the SIMATH Makefiles, you
    should install GNU "make". 

    On HP workstations you will probably need the GNU C compiler,
    "gcc". You can find "gcc" on many ftp servers. 

    Please notice that you will need about 50 MB disk space while
    compiling SIMATH.

    If you have any problems in compiling SIMATH, please mail to
	simath@math.uni-sb.de.

 1. Before you can start installing SIMATH, you must get the file
    ./sources/srclib.kern from the SIMATH group. ./sources/srclib.kern
    is _not_ part of the SIMATH distribution. You will not be able to
    compile SIMATH programs without ./sources/srclib.kern. To get this
    file please send email to
	simath@math.uni-sb.de.  
    We will send you ./sources/srclib.kern as soon as possible.

    We also have installed an email server that will immediately
    respond to your request for ./sources/srclib.kern. Send an email
    message containing the lines

	BEGIN
	SEND srclib.kern-3.10.2.tar 
	END

    or the lines

	BEGIN
	SEND srclib.kern-3.10.2.shar
	END

    to the email server
	mail-server@emmy.math.uni-sb.de
    in order to get the tar file srclib.kern-3.10.2.tar or the shell
    archive srclib.kern-3.10.2.shar containing srclib.kern and a file
    named README_KERN.

    Note that srclib.kern-3.10.2.tar is encoded with uuencode before it
    is sent. Therefore, we recommend that you get srclib.kern-3.10.2.shar
    and unpack it using /bin/sh (which is easier).

    Also note that your messages to mail-server@emmy.math.uni-sb.de are
    processed automatically, so they should not contain more than the
    request for srclib.kern-3.10.2.tar or srclib.kern-3.10.2.shar. If you
    have problems or suggestions, please mail to
	simath@math.uni-sb.de.

    When you get the mail file, first remove the email heading (and
    footing, if any).
	
    If you have got the tar file srclib.kern-3.10.2.tar, type
	"uudecode <MailFile>"
    to decode the file and then
	"tar xvf srclib.kern-3.10.2.tar"
    to extract srclib.kern and README_KERN. Read README_KERN and copy
    srclib.kern into the directory ./sources.

    If you have got the shell archive srclib.kern-3.10.2.shar, type
	"/bin/sh <MailFile>"
    to extract srclib.kern and README_KERN. Read README_KERN and copy
    srclib.kern into the directory ./sources.

    From now on, we suppose that you have got ./sources/srclib.kern and
    have installed it correctly (in the directory ./sources).

 2. On all platforms except on Apollo workstations, the GNU "readline"
    library will be used in simcalc.  This has many advantages such as
    emacs style command line editing and function name completion.
    Starting with Version 3.10.2, the readline library is part of the
    SIMATH distribution (see ./readline-2.0) and compiled
    automatically. You don't have to care about readline anymore.

 3. Together with the Kant group, we have implemented an interface
    between the SIMATH libraries and the libraries of the computer
    algebra package Kant. The latest version of Kant should be
    available from
	ftp.math.tu-berlin.de:/pub/algebra/Kant.
    Unfortunately, the SIMATH-Kant interface does not seem to be
    supported in newer versions of Kant. If you really have to call
    Kant procedures from SIMATH programs, please contact us. We will
    try to find a way.

 4.a) Now type
	"./configure"
    or
	"./configure --prefix=SM_HOME.

    If you simply type "./configure", SIMATH will be installed in the
    directory /usr/local/simath. If you use "--prefix=SM_HOME" (where
    SM_HOME is a path to a directory), e.g.
	"./configure --prefix=/usr/math",
    all SIMATH files will be installed in /usr/math/simath. The
    "configure" script determines certain properties of your machine
    and creates some files (e.g. Makefiles and  C header files)
    reflecting these properties.

    We now assume that you have run the "configure" script.
    
 4.b) The executable SIMATH files must reside in the directory
    SM_HOME/proc. You can append this directory to your search path, or
    you can edit ./Makefile.flags and set BINDIR to one of those
    directories which are already included in your search path, for
    example
	BINDIR=/usr/local/bin.
    There is a target called "links" in ./Makefile which creates links
    to the executable files in SM_HOME/proc. BINDIR should be set to
    SM_HOME/bin by the configure script (or to /usr/local/bin if you
    ran configure without the "--prefix" option).

 4.c) Set MAX_BLOCK_NUMBER in ./smconfig.h according to the main memory of
    your system. Read the instructions in ./smconfig.h.

 5. If you are using an Apollo workstation, you should now change to
    version bsd4.3 (by typing "ver bsd4.3"). Of course SIMATH will also
    run in the sys5.3 environment after the installation is finished.

 7. Type "make" in the current directory. (Be sure, that GNU "make" is
    executed if you are on a system that requires GNU "make".) This
    will compile all executable SIMATH files, the SIMATH calculator
    (simcalc) and the SIMATH object libraries. It may take a few hours,
    depending on your machine.

 8. Type "make SIMATH_install" to install the files in the directory
    SM_HOME/simath. The following object-libraries will be copied into
    the directory SM_HOME/simath/modlib:
      lib_arith1.a   lib_ec1.a   lib_matr1.a   lib_pol1.a   lib_list.h
      lib_arith2.a   lib_ec2.a   lib_matr2.a   lib_pol2.a   lib_kern.h
      lib_arith3.a   lib_ec3.a   lib_matr3.a   lib_pol3.a	
      lib_arith4.a   lib_ec4.a                 lib_pol4.a 
    If it is not the first time you install SIMATH in the directory
    SM_HOME/simath, "make SIMATH_install" will overwrite the former
    version. Therefore you should save the libraries if you modified
    them.

 9. Type "make links" to create links for the executable files (SM,
    CCC, simcalc, cmd and srctrans and dr) in SM_HOME/proc [if you like
    (see 4.b))].

10. "make clean" will try to remove everything that was not part of the
    original tar-file (except ./sources/srclib.kern).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  After having compiled and installed everything, you will find an
executable file called "CCC" and a shell script called "srctrans" in
SM_HOME/proc (and possibly links in BINDIR). Please read the
descriptions below carefully before using them.

CCC:             
	usage: CCC prog [ar1 ... arn]

	CCC compiles a SIMATH program "prog.S" to an executable file
	"prog.x". The file "prog.S" must contain one main function.
	Necessary C functions or SIMATH functions needed will be linked
	automatically. If supplementary object libraries ar1 ... arn
	are specified (where ar1 stands for
	SM_HOME/simath/modlib/libar1.a), CCC will give them to the
	linker, and they will have priority over all SIMATH libraries.
	CCC is useful if you want to compile a SIMATH program within a
	shell script. (Also see the description of 'C' and "CCC" in
	section 2.4.2 of the SIMATH manual).

srctrans:       
	usage: srctrans source_library object_library

	srctrans compiles each file "name.S" contained in the archive
	"source_library" to the object module "name.o" (using "cc -c
	name.S ...") and puts all object modules into the library
	"object_library". Error messages of the compiler are written
	into the file srctrans.fehl. You must not start two srctrans at
	the same time in the same directory.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  If you want to print a file "name.S" by typing 'P' in the SIMATH
menu, you need an executable file SM_HOME/simath/proc/dr which sends a
single file to your favorite printer. If ${SM_HOME}/simath/proc/dr
(which is very very simple) does not work, modify it according to your
system.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  You will find LaTeX sources and a .dvi file of the SIMATH manual in
the directory ./doc.
