 0. The SIMATH directory structure has changed since the last release.
    Therefore there might be some minor bugs in the installation
    procedure.

    We have been working on a simplification of the installation
    procedure, and SIMATH 4.0 uses gnu autoconf, i.e "configure" shell
    scripts, to determine most of its configuration parameters.

    Currently, on all platforms, SIMATH is being developed using the GNU
    C compiler "gcc", so there might be some unexpected problems with
    native compilers. "gcc" is available from many ftp servers all over
    the world, such as prep.ai.mit.edu and its mirrors.

    On some machines you might need GNU "make". You should find GNU
    "make" where you found "gcc".  Be sure that GNU "make" is actually
    named "make" and occurs in the search path of your shell before the
    system's "make". If you are not sure whether your "make" can handle
    the SIMATH Makefiles, you should install GNU "make".

    Please notice that you will need about 50 MB disk space while
    compiling SIMATH.

    If you have any problems in compiling SIMATH, please mail to
	simath@math.uni-sb.de.

 1. The GNU "readline" library will be used in simcalc. This has many
    advantages such as emacs style command line editing and function name
    completion. The "readline" library is part of the SIMATH distribution
    (see ./readline-2.0) and compiled automatically. You don't have to
    care about getting "readline".

 2.a) Now type
	"./configure"
    or
	"./configure --prefix=SM_HOME.

    If you simply type "./configure", SIMATH will be installed in the
    directory /usr/local/simath. If you use "--prefix=SM_HOME" (where
    SM_HOME is a path to a directory), e.g.
	"./configure --prefix=/usr/math",
    all SIMATH files will be installed in /usr/math/simath. The
    "configure" script determines certain properties of your machine and
    creates some files (e.g. Makefiles and C header files) reflecting
    these properties.

    On some HP machines you might get an error like
	./configure: sh internal 2K buffer overflow
    from /bin/sh. In this case you should rerun ./configure using /bin/ksh
    or bash, e.g.
	"/bin/ksh ./configure"
    or
	"/bin/ksh ./configure --prefix=SM_HOME.

    We now assume that you have successfully run the "configure" script.
    
 2.b) The executable SIMATH files must reside in the directory
    SM_HOME/bin. You can append this directory to your search path, or you
    can edit ./Makefile.flags and set BINDIR to one of those directories
    which are already included in your search path, for example
	BINDIR=/usr/local/bin.
    There is a target named "links" in ./Makefile which creates links
    to the executable files in SM_HOME/bin. BINDIR should be set to
    SM_HOME/bin by the configure script (or to /usr/local/bin if you
    ran configure without the "--prefix" option).

 2.c) Set MAX_BLOCK_NUMBER in ./smconfig.h according to the main memory of
    your system. Read the instructions in ./smconfig.h.

 3. Type "make" in the current directory. (Be sure, that GNU "make" is
    executed if you are on a system that requires GNU "make".) This
    will compile all executable SIMATH files, the SIMATH calculator
    (simcalc) and the SIMATH object libraries. It may take a few hours,
    depending on your machine.

 4. Type "make SIMATH_install" to install the files in the directory
    SM_HOME/simath. The following object-libraries will be copied into
    the directory SM_HOME/simath/lib:
      lib_arith1.a   lib_ec1.a   lib_matr1.a   lib_pol1.a   lib_list.h
      lib_arith2.a   lib_ec2.a   lib_matr2.a   lib_pol2.a   lib_kern.h
      lib_arith3.a   lib_ec3.a   lib_matr3.a   lib_pol3.a	
      lib_arith4.a   lib_ec4.a                 lib_pol4.a 
    If it is not the first time you install SIMATH in the directory
    SM_HOME/simath, "make SIMATH_install" will overwrite the former
    version. Therefore you should save the libraries if you modified
    them. 

 5. Type "make links" to create links for the executable files (SM,
    CCC, simcalc, xsrc, smman and smsrc, cmd and srctrans and dr) in 
    SM_HOME/bin [if you like (see 3.b))].

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  After having compiled and installed everything, you will find an
executable file named "CCC" SM_HOME/bin (and possibly links in BINDIR).
Please read the description below carefully before using them.

CCC:             
	usage: CCC prog [ar1 ... arn]

	CCC compiles a SIMATH main program "prog.S" to an executable
	file "prog.x". Necessary C functions or SIMATH functions
	needed will be linked automatically. If supplementary object
	libraries ar1 ... arn are specified (where ar1 stands for
	SM_HOME/simath/lib/libar1.a), CCC will give them to the linker,
	and they will have priority over all SIMATH libraries.	CCC is
	useful if you want to compile a SIMATH program within a shell
	script. (Also see the description of 'C' and "CCC" in section
	2.4.2 of the SIMATH manual).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  If you want to print a file "name.S" by typing 'P' in the SIMATH
menu, you need an executable file SM_HOME/simath/bin/dr which sends a
single file to your favorite printer. If ${SM_HOME}/simath/bin/dr
(which is very very simple) does not work, modify it according to your
system.
