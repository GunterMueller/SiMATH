The computer algebra system SIMATH is written in C. It has been
developed for research purposes by the SIMATH group of Prof. Dr. H.G.
Zimmer at the University of Saarland in Saarbruecken, Germany. The
development has been partially supported by the Siemens AG.

Up to now we are running SIMATH on the following machines: 
	Sun 3/80 under SunOS 4.0.3,
	Sun SPARCstation under SunOS 4.1.1,
	HP 9000 series 700 under HP-UX 9.05,
	Apollo DN 3000 under SR10.1,
	Apollo DN 4500 under SR10.1,
	SGI Challenge under IRIX 5.2.
	Linux 1.1.51

If you are using a different machine (and/or operating system), you can
(and you should) try to install SIMATH. If you are successful, please
let us know. If you had to change some of the SIMATH source files,
please inform us of the changes to be made.
