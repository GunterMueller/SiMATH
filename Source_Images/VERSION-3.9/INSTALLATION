 0. This is one of the first versions of SIMATH which is installed by
    Makefiles instead of shell scripts.Therefore there might be some
    minor bugs in the installation procedure.

    We have been working on a simplification of the installation
    procedure, and SIMATH-3.9 now uses gnu autoconf, i.e "configure"
    shell scripts, to determine most of its configuration parameters.

    At least on SGI and Apollo (and probably on HP) computers you will
    need GNU "make". GNU "make" is available from many ftp servers all
    over the world, and it compiles even on Apollos without problems.
    Be sure that GNU "make" is actually named "make" and occurs in the
    search path of your shell before the system's "make". If you are
    not sure if your "make" can handle the SIMATH Makefiles, you should
    install GNU "make".

    On HP workstations you will probably need the GNU C compiler,
    "gcc". You can find "gcc" on many ftp servers.

    If you have any problems in compiling SIMATH, please mail to
	simath@math.uni-sb.de.

 1. Before you can start installing SIMATH, you must get the file
    ./sources/srclib.kern from the SIMATH group. ./sources/srclib.kern
    is _not_ part of the SIMATH distribution. You will not be able to
    compile SIMATH programs without ./sources/srclib.kern. To get this
    file please send email to
	simath@math.uni-sb.de.  
    We will send you ./sources/srclib.kern as soon as possible.

    We also have installed an email server that will immediately
    respond to your request for ./sources/srclib.kern. Send an email
    message containing the lines

	BEGIN
	SEND srclib.kern-3.9.tar 
	END

    or the lines

	BEGIN
	SEND srclib.kern-3.9.shar
	END

    to the email server
	mail-server@emmy.math.uni-sb.de
    in order to get the tar file srclib.kern-3.9.tar or the shell
    archive srclib.kern-3.9.shar containing srclib.kern and a file
    README_KERN.

    Note that srclib.kern-3.9.tar is encoded with uuencode before it is
    sent. Therefore, we recommend that you get srclib.kern-3.9.shar and
    unpack it using /bin/sh.

    Also note, that your messages to mail-server@emmy.math.uni-sb.de
    are processed automatically, so they should not contain more than
    the request for srclib.kern-3.9.tar or srclib.kern-3.9.shar. If you
    have problems or suggestions, please mail to
	simath@math.uni-sb.de.

    When you get the mail file, first remove the email heading (and
    footing, if any).
	
    If you have got the tar file srclib.kern-3.9.tar, type
	"uudecode <MailFile>"
    to decode the file and then
	"tar xvf srclib.kern-3.9.tar"
    to extract srclib.kern and README_KERN. Read README_KERN and copy
    srclib.kern into the directory ./sources.

    If you have got the shell archive srclib.kern-3.9.shar, type
	"/bin/sh <MailFile>"
    to extract srclib.kern and README_KERN. Read README_KERN and copy
    srclib.kern into the directory ./sources.

    We hope, this will enable us to keep track of all the people who
    are interested in SIMATH.

    From now on, we suppose that you have got ./sources/srclib.kern and
    have installed it correctly (in the directory ./sources).


 2. On all platforms except for Apollo workstations we recommend to use
    the GNU "readline" library in simcalc. This has many advantages
    such as emacs style command line editing and function name
    completion. "readline" is available on many ftp servers all over
    the world. You will need at least version 2. (See also 5.)

 3. Together with the Kant group, we have implemented an interface
    between SIMATH and the computer algebra package Kant. The latest
    version of Kant is available from
	ftp.math.tu-berlin.de 
    in the directory 
	/pub/algebra/Kant. 
    If you intend to use the SIMATH-Kant interface, you will need at
    least version V2R2p7 of Kant.

 4.a) Now type
	"./configure"
    or
	"./configure --prefix=SM_HOME.

    If you simply type "./configure", SIMATH will be installed in the
    directory /usr/local/simath. If you use "--prefix=SM_HOME" (where
    SM_HOME is a path to a directory), e.g.
	"./configure --prefix=/usr/math"
    all SIMATH files will be installed in /usr/math/simath. The
    "configure" script determines certain properties of your machine
    and creates some files (e.g. Makefiles and a C header) reflecting
    these properties.

    We now assume that you have run the "configure" script.
    
 b) The executable SIMATH files must reside in the directory
    SM_HOME/proc. You can append this directory to your search path, or
    you can edit ./Makefile.flags and set BINDIR to one of those
    directories which are already included in your search path, for
    example
	BINDIR=/usr/local/bin.
    There is a target called "links" in ./Makefile which creates links
    to the executable files in SM_HOME/proc. If you ran "configure"
    without "--prefix=SM_HOME", BINDIR has been set automatically to
    /usr/local/bin.

 c) If you want to use the Kant interface, you also have to modify
    ./config.h. Please read the comments in ./config.h. On
    SPARCstations running SunOS 4.1.x you have to edit ./Makefile.flags   
    and ./proc/SM.h because Kant requires gcc on this host. In
    ./Makefile.flags replace "CC=cc" by "CC=gcc" and in
    ./proc/SM.h replace "cc" by "gcc" and the path to "cc" by the path
    to "gcc".

 d) Set MAX_BLOCK_NUMBER in ./config.h according to the main memory of
    your system. Read the instructions in ./config.h.

 5. If you intend to use the GNU readline library, modify RL_INCLUDE
    and RL_FLAGS in ./Makefile.flags according to your system. Follow
    the instructions in the Makefile.

 6. If you are using an Apollo workstation, you should now change to
    version bsd4.3 (by typing "ver bsd4.3"). Of course SIMATH will also
    run in the sys5.3 environment after the installation.

 7. Type "make" in the current directory. (Be sure, that GNU "make" is
    executed if you are on a system that requires GNU "make".) This
    will compile all executable SIMATH files, the SIMATH calculator
    (simcalc) and the SIMATH object libraries. It will take a few
    hours, depending on your machine.

 8. Type "make SIMATH_install" to install the files in the directory
    SM_HOME/simath. The following object-libraries will be copied into
    the directory SM_HOME/simath/modlib:
      lib_arith1.a   lib_ec1.a   lib_matr1.a   lib_pol1.a   lib_list.h
      lib_arith2.a   lib_ec2.a   lib_matr2.a   lib_pol2.a   lib_kern.h
      lib_arith3.a   lib_ec3.a   lib_matr3.a   lib_pol3.a	
      lib_arith4.a   lib_ec4.a                 lib_pol4.a 
    If it is not the first time you install SIMATH in the directory
    SM_HOME/simath, "make SIMATH_install" will overwrite the former
    version.  Therefore you should save the libraries if you modified
    them.

 9. Type "make links" to create links for the executable files (SM, CC,
    CCC, simcalc, cmd and srctrans and dr) in SM_HOME/proc [if you like
    (see 4.b))].

11. "make clean" will try to remove everything that was not part of
    the original tar-file (except ./sources/srclib.kern).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  After having compiled and installed everything, you will find two
helpful shell scripts called "srctrans" and "CC" in SM_HOME/proc (and
possibly in BINDIR). Please read the descriptions below carefully,
before using them.

CC:             CC prog [ar1 ... arn]

	CC compiles a SIMATH program "prog.S" to an executable file
	"prog.x". The file "prog.S" must contain one main-function.
	C-functions or SIMATH functions which are needed will be linked
	automatically. If supplementary object-libraries ar1 ... arn
	are specified (where ar1 stands for SM_HOME/simath/modlib/libar1.a), 
	CC will give them to the loader, and they will have priority
	over all SIMATH libraries.  CC is useful, if you want to
	compile a SIMATH program within a shell script. The executable
	file "prog.x" is stripped. If you want to avoid this, use
		CCC prog [ar1 ... arn]
	(see also the description of 'C' and "CCC" in section 2.4.2 of
	the SIMATH manual).

srctrans:       srctrans source_library object_library

	srctrans compiles each file "name.S" contained in the archive
	"source_library" to the object module "name.o" (using "cc -c
	name.S ...") and puts all object modules into the library
	"object_library". Error messages of the compiler are written
	into the file srctrans.fehl. You should not start two srctrans
	at the same time in the same directory.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  If you want to print a file "name.S" by typing 'P' in the SIMATH
menu, you must have an executable file ${SM_HOME}/simath/proc/dr which
sends a single file to your favorite printer. If ${SM_HOME}/simath/proc/dr 
(which is very very simple) does not work, modify it according to your system.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Remark: You will find LaTeX sources and a .dvi file of the SIMATH
manual in the directory ./doc.
