0. Before you can start installing SIMATH, you must get the file
   ./sources/srclib.kern from the SIMATH group. ./sources/srclib.kern
   is _not_ part of the SIMATH distribution. You will not be able to
   compile SIMATH programs without ./sources/srclib.kern. In order to
   get this file please send email to
	simath@math.uni-sb.de.  
   We will send you ./sources/srclib.kern as soon as possible.

   We also have installed an email server that will immediately respond
   to your request for ./sources/srclib.kern. Send an email message
   containing the lines
	BEGIN
	SEND srclib.kern-3.7.tar 
	END
   or the lines
	BEGIN
	SEND srclib.kern-3.7.shar
	END
   to the email server
	mail-server@emmy.math.uni-sb.de
   in order to get the tar file srclib.kern-3.7.tar or the shell
   archive srclib.kern-3.7.shar containing srclib.kern and a file
   README_KERN.

   Note that srclib.kern-3.7.tar is encoded with uuencode before it is
   sent. Therefore we recommend that you get srclib.kern-3.7.shar and
   unpack it using /bin/sh.

   Note that your messages to mail-server@emmy.math.uni-sb.de are
   processed automatically, so they should not contain more than the
   request for srclib.kern-3.7.tar or srclib.kern-3.7.shar. If you have
   problems or suggestions please mail to simath@math.uni-sb.de.

   When you get the mail file, remove the email heading (and footing,
   if there is any).
	
   If you have got the tar file srclib.kern-3.7.tar type
	"uudecode <MailFile>"
   to decode the file and then
	"tar xvf srclib.kern-3.7.tar"
   to extract srclib.kern and README_KERN. Read README_KERN and copy 
   srclib.kern into the directory ./sources.

   If you have got the shell archive srclib.kern-3.7.shar type
	"/bin/sh <MailFile>"
   to extract srclib.kern and README_KERN. Read README_KERN and copy
   srclib.kern into the directory ./sources.

   We hope, this will enable us to keep track of all the people who are
   interrested in SIMATH.

   From now on, we suppose that you have got ./sources/srclib.kern and
   have installed it correctly (in the directory ./sources).

1. Edit the files ./site.h and ./Makefile. In both files you must set
   the variable SM_HOME to the path where you want the system to be
   installed; for example
	SM_HOME=/usr/local/simath 
   in ./Makefile and
   	#define SM_HOME "/usr/local/simath"
   in ./site.h

2. The SIMATH executable files must reside in the directory
   SM_HOME/proz. You can append this directory to your search path, or
   you can edit ./Makefile and set BINDIR to one of those directories
   which are already included in your search path, for example
	BINDIR=/usr/local/bin.
   There is a target called "links" in ./Makefile which creates links
   to the executable files in SM_HOME/proz.
   Change the variables INSTALLDIR, INSTALLFILE and LN in ./Makefile
   according to your system.

3. Copy one of the files _rechner.* to _rechner.h by typing 
	"cp _rechner.apo10000 _rechner.h" on Apollo DN10000,
	"cp _rechner.apollo _rechner.h"   on Apollo DN4500 and DN3000,
	"cp _rechner.sparc _rechner.h"    on Sun/Sparc, 
	"cp _rechner.sun _rechner.h"      on other Suns. 

4. If you are using an Apollo workstation, you should now change to
   version bsd4.3 (by typing "ver bsd4.3"). Of course the system will
   also run in the sys5.3 environment.

5. Type "make" in the current directory. This will compile all SIMATH
   executable files, the SIMATH calculator (simcalc) and the SIMATH
   object-libraries. It will take 2 to 12 hours depending on your
   machine. When "make" is finished you will find a file
   ./___SRCTRANS/srctrans.fehl which contains a list of all SIMATH
   source files that could not be compiled together with the
   corresponding compiler messages. Type
	"fgrep Could ___SRCTRANS/srctrans.fehl".
   You should get only 5 lines of output:
	Could not compile getocnt.S
	Could not compile setocnt.S
	Could not compile errmsg.S
	Could not compile globbind.S
	Could not compile tracemsg.S
   (Don't worry about these 5 error messages. The functions getocnt,
   setocnt, errmsg, tracemsg and globbind will nevertheless be compiled
   correctly.)
   
6. Type "make SIMATH_install" to install the files in the directory
   SM_HOME. The following object-libraries will be copied into the
   directory SM_HOME/modlib:
   lib_TEST1.a   lib_arith1.a   lib_ec1.a    lib_matr1.a   lib_pol1.a
   lib_TEST2.a   lib_arith2.a   lib_ec2.a    lib_matr2.a   lib_pol2.a
   lib_TEST3.a   lib_arith3.a   lib_ec3.a    lib_matr3.a   lib_pol3.a	
   lib_TEST4.a   lib_arith4.a   lib_ec4.a    		   lib_pol4.a 
   lib_list.a    lib_kern.a
   If it is not the first time you install SIMATH in the directory 
   SM_HOME, "make SIMATH_install" will overwrite the former version. 

7. Type "make links" to create links for the executable files (SM, CC,
   TCC, CCC, TCCC, simcalc and srctrans) contained in SM_HOME/proz [if
   you like this (see 2.)]. If one of the files SM, CC, CC, TCC, CCC,
   TCCC, simcalc and srctrans already exists in the directory BINDIR,
   overwriting will depend on your choice of the variable LN in the
   Makefile. (For example LN=cp will overwrite and LN=ln will not.)

8. "make clean" will try to remove everything that was not part of the
   original tar-file (except ./sources/srclib.kern).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  After having compiled and installed everything, you will find three
helpful shell scripts called "srctrans", "CC" and "TCC" in SM_HOME/proz
(and possibly in BINDIR). Please read the descriptions below carefully,
in order to use them. In each file there exists a variable SM_HOME1.
Edit the scripts and set SM_HOME1 to the same value as SM_HOME in the
Makefile, for example
	SM_HOME1=/usr/local/simath.



CC:             CC prog [ar1 ... arn]

	CC compiles a SIMATH program "prog.S" to an executable file
	"prog.x". The file "prog.S" must contain one main-function.
	C-functions or SIMATH functions which are needed will be linked
	automatically. If supplementary object-libraries ar1 ... are
	specified (where ar1 stands for SM_HOME/modlib/libar1.a), CC
	will give them to the loader, and they will have priority over
	all SIMATH libraries. CC is useful if you want to compile a
	SIMATH program within a shell script. The executable file
	"prog.x" is stripped. If you want to avoid this, use
		CCC prog [ar1 ... arn]
	(see also the description of 'C' and "CCC" in section 2.4.2 of
	the SIMATH manual).

TCC:            TCC prog  [ar1 ... arn]
	    or  TCCC prog [ar1 ... arn]     (if you need an unstripped
					     program prog.x)

	TCC does the same as CC but the resulting file "prog.x" is the
	test version of the SIMATH program "prog.S". For more
	information about test versions, please read the descriptions
	of 'T' and "TCCC" in section 2.4.2 of our manual.

srctrans:       srctrans source_library object_library

	srctrans compiles each file "name.S" contained in the archive
	"source_library" to the object module "name.o" (using "cc -c
	name.S ...") and puts all object modules into the library
	"object_library". Error messages of the compiler are written in
	the file srctrans.fehl. You should not start two srctrans at
	the same time in the same directory.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  If you want to print a file "name.S" by typing 'P' in the SIMATH
menu, you must have an executable file ${SM_HOME}/proz/dr which sends a
single file to your favorite printer. The file ${SM_HOME}/proz/dr
included in this software (which is very very simple) might not work on
your machine.

  Remark: You will find LaTeX sources and a .dvi file of the SIMATH
manual in the directory doc.
