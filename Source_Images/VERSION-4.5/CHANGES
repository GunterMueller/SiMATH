---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 4.4.1 --- Version 4.5

  A lot of function about cyclotomic units, esp. iscynfHS.S

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 4.4 --- Version 4.4.1

  We have done some bug-fixes related to the construction of prime numbers.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 4.3 --- Version 4.4

  Version 4.4 of SIMATH has a new arithmetic for GF(2). We have further
  done some minor changes and some bug-fixes. 

  About 80% of the online help system has been translated to English.

  For the changes in simcalc see ?NEW in simcalc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 4.2 --- Version 4.3

 We have done some bug-fixes and minor changes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 4.1 --- Version 4.2

 We have done bug-fixes and added some programs for quadratic function
fields.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 4.0.1 --- Version 4.1

  Version 4.1 is a regular update of Version 4.0.1. 

  SIMATH now includes functions for computing the height of points on
elliptic curves over quadratic number fields and the regulator of elliptic
curves over quadratic number fields.

  About 50% of the online help system has been translated to English.

  Some bugs of Version 4.0.1 have been fixed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 4.0 --- Version 4.0.1
  
  Version 4.0.1 fixes some bugs related to the computation of the
Mordell-Weil group of elliptic curves over rational numbers in
simcalc as well as some problems with the installation.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.10.3 --- Version 4.0

  Version 4.0 has a new directory structure. The directories ./proc,
./header, and ./modlib have been renamed ./bin, ./include, and ./lib.
The SIMATH source libraries have been replaced by ordinary directories.

  SIMATH now includes functions for computing the rank of an elliptic
curve over real quadratic fields of class number one. 

  Some problems related to the root finding of univariate polynomials
and to the computation of rank and integral points of elliptic curves
have been fixed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.10.2 --- Version 3.10.3

  Version 3.10.3 fixes some problems with garbage collection on Linux 
machines and includes a FreeBSD port. For all other machines, 3.10.3
is identical to 3.10.2.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.10.1 --- Version 3.10.2

  3.10.2 is an intermediate release (mainly for Siemens). The main
differences to 3.10.1 are 
 - some improved routines for matrices over Z/2Z,
 - some extended input and output functions and
 - some bug fixes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.10 --- Version 3.10.1

  Version 3.10 has been withdrawn shortly after it was released because
there were some bugs in the elliptic curve subsystem. These have been fixed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.9 --- Version 3.10

  As usual, when a new version is released, there are some new and
improved algorithms, and many new programs have been incorporated into
simcalc. The basic structure of SIMATH has remained essentially
unchanged.

  The GNU readline library is now part of the SIMATH distribution. This
should make installation a little bit easier.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.8.1 --- Version 3.9

  We have implemented a new online documentation system. The
documentation of a given SIMATH function is now extracted from the
source file. This reduces the size of the system by more than 3 MB.

  SIMATH is now installed using GNU autoconf, i.e. "configure" scripts
to determine most of the configuration parameters automatically. The
installation of SIMATH is therefore much easier.

  We have implemented an algorithm for determining all integral points
on an elliptic curve. For more information see the documentation of
ecisnfsaip().

  An algorithm for factoring univariate polynomials over algebraic
number fields (upnffact()) has been implemented.

  The following is a list of some of the new simcalc functions and
features.
General functions:
  - predefinitions for simcalc are read from the file .simcalcrc
  - arrays are allowed in variable names
User interface:
  - user-defined functions have been implemented, sums and products of
    indexed expressions can be easily computed
Elliptic curves:
  - ntpair computes the Neron-Tate pairing
  - whei computes the Weil height    
  - faintp tries to find all integral points on an elliptic curve
Z/mZ:
  - primitive roots and the order of elements in the unit group of Z/mZ 
    can be computed using proot and ord
Polynomials:
  - froot tries to find roots of univariate polynomials over Z/pZ
  - irpgen generates irreducible polynomials over Z/pZ and Z/2Z
  - fact has been extended to univariate polynomials over number fields 
    and prime ideal factorization in quadratic number fields
  - relcln computes the relative class number of abelian number fields

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.7 --- Version 3.8.1

  At least on Sun workstations, simcalc is now able to use the GNU
readline library. This allows an emacs style command line editing in
simcalc. (The GNU readline library is available from many ftp servers
all over the world.)

  The arithmetic of finite fields (of arbitrary degree over the prime
subfield) is implemented now in simcalc.

  Some new functions (ecgnp, fp, npfe) for elliptic curves over finite
fields have been added to simcalc.

  The test system is no longer part of the SIMATH distribution. Thus,
the SIMATH sources are a little bit smaller.

  We have implemented a combined Schoof-Shanks algorithm for counting
points on elliptic curves over finite fields of characteristic 2.

  Tate's algorithm is now available for curves over quadratic number
fields.

  A new floating point arithmetic, the so-called "Papanikolaou floating
point arithmetic" ("PAF arithmetic") is accessible from within SIMATH.

  The system has been ported to HP and SGI workstations. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.6.1 --- Version 3.7
  
  Elliptic curves and points of elliptic curves are now implemented in
a more efficient manner. Many higher algorithms for elliptic curves are
available in simcalc.

  The arithmetic of finite fields is now available in simcalc. 
  
  A comprehensive Groebner bases algorithm has been added to the
libraries.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.5 --- Version 3.6.1

  The manual and the online help of simcalc are now available in
English.

  The libraries lib_ec3.a and lib_ec4.a and the headers _ec3.h, _ec4.h,
_Tec3.h and _Tec4.h have been added. They will be used for elliptic
curves in later releases of SIMATH.

  A Groebner basis algorithm for several domains and the arithmetic of
elliptic curves over finite fields of characteristic 2 have been added
to the libraries.

  The arithmetic of Z/pZ and number fields is now available in
simcalc.
