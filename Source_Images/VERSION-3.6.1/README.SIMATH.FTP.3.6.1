    	Two ways to get SIMATH via anonymous ftp
	
    	The first:
You get the file "SIMATH-3.6.1.tar.Z". This is a compressed tar-file. You
can unpack it by typing
	'zcat SIMATH-3.6.1.tar.Z | tar xvf -'
for example.


    	The second:
You get all the files "SIMATH-3.6.1.??". These are pieces of the
compressed tar-file mentioned above. You will have to put the pieces
together by typing
	'cat SIMATH-3.6.1.?? | uncompress | tar xvf -'
for example.
