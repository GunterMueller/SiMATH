.SH NAME
pmakevl - polynomial make list of variables

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include<_pol1.h>

list pmakevl(s)  
char* s;

.SH DESCRIPTION
pmakevl creates a list of variables names, used for example by getp... and putp... .
The first character of a variable's name must be a letter, all other characters must be alphanumeric. All non-alphanumeric characters will be interpreted as seperators of two variable names.

.SH EXAMPLES
To create a polynomial in the variables a1, x, var1, 'getpi(r, V)' uses the list V of variable names.
V is generated by V = pmakevl("a1 x var1");

.SH NOTES
.TP 3
1.)
Internally SIMATH represents a variables name as a list consisting of the several characters ascii codes.
.TP 3 
2.)
SIMATH use the last entry of the variables names list as the name of the main variable, which many functions refer to, so it is advisable to put the name of the most used variable at the end of the list.
