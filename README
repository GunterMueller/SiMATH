The number theoretic system SIMATH is written in C, being developed
for research purpose by the SIMATH development group of Prof. Dr.
NAKAMULA, Ken at Tokyo Metropolitan University (TMU), Japan.  The
development is being partially supported by the Siemens AG, BRD.

Up to now we are running SIMATH on the following platforms:
	on Sun workstations under SunOS 4.0.3 and SunOS 4.1.x
	on HP 9000 series 700 under HP-UX 10.20
	on SGI computers under IRIX 5.2
	on PCs under different Linux kernels
	on HP AlphaServer under HP Tru64 UNIX
These are the machines we use for the development of SIMATH.  It
should not be so difficult to port SIMATH to other operating systems.
If you are using a different machine (and/or operating system), you
can (and you should) try to install SIMATH.  If you are successful,
please let us know.  If you had to change some of the SIMATH source
files, please inform us of the changes to be made.

If you have any problems or suggestions, please contact us by mail:

We have set up a mailing list to discuss several problems related to
the number theoretic system SIMATH among the users of the system.
Send an email to
	simath-user-request@tnt.math.metro-u.ac.jp
including the line
	info
in the message of the mail in order to get information on the mailing
list, and include the line
	subscribe
in order to join the mailing list for discussing anything related to
SIMATH.

The latest version of SIMATH may be obtained from
